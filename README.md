# Camera_Simulation_Images
Design and modeling of a virtual 3D graphic scene with all lighting effects: light source, rays, reflections, transparencies, etc. 
Principles of object-oriented model development and abstraction.

The "scene" class contains all the scene information such as: the camera location, lightings and shapes in space.
The “ImageWrite” class actually produces the image
The “Render” class produces the image according to the data in the scene
A test file must be created for running.
